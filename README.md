# CommunityCloud Pi

As part of my Capstone Project for UTS I created the Community Cloud project to connect neighbourhoods together.

The Community Cloud is a cloud social application that connects users within the same neighbourhood togehter along with emergency services for the surrounding neighbourhood.

The idea is that neighbourhoods could be resiliant and work together to ensure the safety of all residence within the community.

If someone reported a fire, robbery, or any other emergency they would post the alert on the Community Cloud and people within that area would be notified

This project is the java project that would run on a Raspberry Pi connected to a monitor within a end user's home to display any alerts in the area
